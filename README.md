# Digital Linguistics Web Styles

Welcome to the Digital Linguistics (DLx) styles library! This website demonstrates how to style linguistic data for presentation on the web using HTML and CSS.

## Using the DLx Styles

DLx styles are available either as standalone CSS files or [LESS files][LESS] files. LESS files must be compiled to CSS before you can use them, whereas CSS files can be used in your HTML project as is. See the [LESS website][LESS] for details on compiling LESS to CSS.

# DLx Styles

This repository contains styles and assets used across DLx projects, and is intended primarily for developers. This project allows DLx developers to apply consistent styling across different sites and projects, and provides a single source of truth for various assets. This works by making the various assets and stylesheets available for linking or download on the DLx CDN.

## Pattern Library

A pattern library demonstrating all the styles in the DLx stylesheet, along with example HTML markup and usage notes. [View the pattern library here][1], where you can also find documentation on how to use DLx styles in your project.

## Images

DLx images and icons are available in the `/img` folder, or may be downloaded or linked to at `https://cdn.digitallinguistics.io/img/{filename}`.

## Fonts

All fonts used by DLx projects may be found in the `/fonts` folder, and are available on the CDN at `https://cdn.digitallinguistics.io/fonts/{font}`.

## Code Style Sheets

* **JavaScript**: An ESLint style sheet for linting code written in JavaScript is available in `/stylesheets/.eslintrc`, or may be downloaded or linked to at `https://cdn.digitallinguistics.io/dev/.eslintrc`.

* **CSS**: A Stylelint style sheet for linting CSS is available in `stylesheets/.stylelintrc`, or may be download or linked to at `https://cdn.digitallinguistics.io/dev/.stylelintrc`.

# Digital Linguistics (DLx) Pattern Library

Welcome to the Digital Linguistics (DLx) styles library! This website demonstrates how to style linguistic data for presentation on the web using HTML and CSS.

[View the GitHub repository for this library.][GitHub]

## Using the DLx Styles

DLx styles are available either as standalone CSS files or [LESS files][LESS] files. LESS files must be compiled to CSS before you can use them, whereas CSS files can be used in your HTML project as is. See the [LESS website][LESS] for details on compiling LESS to CSS.

You can use all the DLx styles in your project by simply linking to the `dlx.css` file in your HTML. You can also use styles for individual components. The CSS for each component is standalone, and can be used in your project without any additional dependencies.

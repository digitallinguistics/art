title: Definitions

# {{ title }}

Use the `<dfn>` element to enclose technical terms being defined. Browsers render this in italics by default, but in order to make definitions more distinct from inline examples, the DLx styles render this in bold.

## Example

<div class=output>
{% include './definition.html' %}
</div>

## HTML

<details open>

  <summary>(Show/Hide HTML)</summary>

```html
{% include './definition.html' %}
```

</details>

## CSS

`.dfn` | `.definition`

<details open>

  <summary>(Show/Hide CSS)</summary>

```css
{% include './definition.css' %}
```

</details>

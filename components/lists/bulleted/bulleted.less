// Bulleted List
//
// In DLx projects, lists are often used semantically rather than stylistically, e.g. a phrase includes a list of words. As such, lists have no styling by default, and list styling needs to be explicitly set with the <code>.bulleted</code> or <code>.numbered</code> styles. List items with text should include a `<p>` tag or other relevant element within them, following the principles of semantic markup.

.bulleted {

  list-style: disc outside none;

  li {
    display: list-item;
  }

}

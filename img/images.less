// Images and other icons used in DLx projects. DLx projects use [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) by default. If an icon is not available with Feather Icons, another medium weight, rounded icon may be used instead. The images below are all non-Feather Icons. Each of the following icons is available in the `/img` folder, and can be linked to via the DLx CDN at `https://digitallinguistics.blob.core.windows.net/img/{filename}`. Many SVG icons are also available in different colors. For example, `blog.svg` is also available as `blog.blue.svg`. Most icons are black by default. Sometimes you may need to set positive or negative margins on the image to make it the same size as other icons. For icons available in different sizes, the size is indicated by appending the dimensions to the filename, after an underscore, e.g. `tunnel_64x64.png`. Additional websites for images include: [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), [Icons 8](https://icons8.com/icons), and [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
